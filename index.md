# About Me

I'm currently an undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur majoring in Mathematics and Computing with a micro specialization in Entrepreneurship and Innovation.

My interests revolve around the letter M: Mathematics, Music and Machine Learning.

If you have a question, want to have an interesting conversation, or just want to say hi, send me an [email](mailto://mohitpokharna08@gmail.com).
