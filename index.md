# About Me

I'm currently an undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur majoring in Mathematics and Computing with a micro specialization in Entrepreneurship and Innovation.

I'm also working as an AI intern for [Silo AI](https://silo.ai/), a private research lab in Finland.

If you have a question, want to have an interesting conversation, or just want to say hi, send me an [email](mailto://mohitpokharna08@gmail.com).
